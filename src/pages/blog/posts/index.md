The National Hockey League has a problem.

To be more exact, two teams in South Florida and Toronto.

## Game 1.

Last night, the Toronto Maple Leafs defeated the Florida Panthers. 

There were enough fireworks for the 4th of July and Canada Day. Thirty seconds into the game, William Nylander opened up the scoresheet with a snipe.

Then, _everybody_ was hitting _everybody._ Both teams set the tone, with the Panthers winning the hit battle 51-24. 

It wouldn’t be Stanley Cup Playoff hockey without a few extracurriculars. 

Anthony Stolarz, the starting goalie for Toronto, was injured by an elbow from Sam Bennett. After a rush towards the net, the 6’6 netminder seemingly took a hit to the head and sprawled out on the ice. He was seen vomiting on the bench. Scotiabank Arena was stunned. Soon after, he was stretchered out of the arena

Right or wrong, that ignited the Cats. 

A 4-1 lead turned 4-3 faster than a blink. Matthew Knies gave the Leafs some breathing room with a breakaway backhanded goal. Unfortunately for the Leafs, Bennett, with the net empty, got them back within one on a whiffed pass from John Tavares.

## Toronto is.. Different?

Right then, it seemed like it would be the same old Leafs. 

Score a SportsCenter Top 10 Goal and then hand the lead back. 

As a longtime fan, all I could think of was the quote from _Squid Game_.

“I’ve played these games before!”. 

Spoiler alert, I don’t like them.

The Boys in Blue did something that they aren’t really known for. They showed some damn grit. 

The Leafs showed up with the Panthers knocking on the doorstep and the pressure mounting. From Scott Laughton to Mitch Marner, everybody put their body on the line to block shots.  

Toronto outhustled a scrappy Panthers team and won the blocked shots battle 24-11. Historically, Florida has dominated the shot blocking metric. In the 2022-2023 second-round series, they blocked more shots than the Leafs _every single game_. Auston Matthews and company were swept in 5.

Today, Coach Berube and his new squad did it just enough to buy the Leafs a win in the series.

Even after the final horn was sounded, players were still being frisky. Matthew Tkachuk may or may not have tried to blindside star Mitch Marner ten feet from the puck. Tkachuk drilled a crosscheck right on Marner’s back.

The refs need to get a hold of this series. Last round, the Panthers retaliated against their captain being injured by Brandon Hagel. 

One thing led to another. A brutal hit hurt Hagel, and the result was that a star defenseman, Aaron Ekblad, was suspended.

Let’s be generous. Maybe Bennett didn’t mean to hit Stolarz in the head. I mean, they were teammates a year ago. 

However, it looks terrible. 

As in, really, really bad.

Sam Bennett is a repeat offender with the NHL Department of Safety and has multiple suspensions. To be fair… the Panthers aren’t exactly known for squeaky clean hockey. They have a reputation as a gnarly team that sometimes goes over the edge. In a perfect world, the two talented rosters chalk it up as a misunderstanding and go back to playing clean, physical hockey. 

Yeah, I laughed at that too.

Leafs’ coach Craig Berube’s thoughts on the scrum that took out his goalie?

### To Mr. Bettman and the NHL Safety Department,

History has shown that people are vengeful. It didn’t help things that another Panthers star had an even more egregious play. More likely than not, if the referees don’t tighten their leash on the game, the Leafs will want to deal with the issue themselves. Then, the Panthers will want to return the favor. Sportsmanship is out the window, and it is all because the refs kept their whistles in their pockets.

Don’t get me wrong. I love setting the tone. For crying out loud, one of my favorite players in basketball is Draymond Green. Sometimes, the game within the game is more exciting. Green is also one of the penalized players in the league.

Right now, these two teams are playing on the edge. At the rate this is going, somebody is going to get hurt.

The NHL is playing with fire to boost ratings.

Don’t burn down the house.
